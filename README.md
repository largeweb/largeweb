Hello! My name is Matthew Gordon. I am completing my Computer Science BS Degree at UNC Chapel Hill. I will finish this degree in Spring 2023.
I am putting all my efforts into computer science because I truly believe the world is heading in an increasingly digital direction, with computers automating everything. I also love learning about new technologies and I am finding myself most excited about the development of the next generation of internet, commonly phrased "Web3", "Decentralized Internet", or "Metaverse". I would love to work on any projects with anyone in this field. Specifically Blockchain Implementations, Blockchain Scaling Solutions, Smart Contract Development, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Virtual Environments, and 3D User Interfaces. Since learning about serverless cloud solutions, I believe much of the development of Web3 will take place in cloud environments. I hope I can gain more exposure to different project architectures that take advantage of the cloud. Lastly, I find myself thinking about the possibilities with Machine Learning from time to time. I know that it is a massive field but I hope one day I can get involved with it as well.

My current plan is to prove my programming skills by building useful programs and hosting them in public repositories here on my GitHub account. I would like to find an internship during Summer 2022 to help me gain exposure to the industry. When I finish my degree in 2023, I may look for another internship or perhaps take on a full-time job if I find one that is a perfect fit. Eventually I would like to join the Web3 movement and work for a company that offers me a great position in this field. My end goal is to become a project manager and help build incredible technologies on a large scale.
