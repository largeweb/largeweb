Hello! My name is Matthew Gordon. I am completing my Computer Science BS Degree at UNC Chapel Hill. I will finish this degree in Spring 2023.
I am putting all my cards into computer science because I truly believe the world is heading in an increasingly digital world, driven by computers. I love learning about new technologies and I am finding myself most excited about the development of the next generation of internet, commonly phrased "Web3", or "Metaverse". I would love to work on any projects with anyone in this field. Specifically Blockchain Implementations, Blockchain Scaling Solutions, Smart Contract Development, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Virtual Environments, and 3D User Interfaces. Since learning about serverless cloud solutions, I believe much of the development of Web3 will take place in cloud environments. I would also love to work on projects using the cloud so I can gain more exposure to different architectures. I believe that learning about various architectures will set me up well for a high-paying job. Lastly, I find myself thinking about the possibilities with Machine Learning from time to time. I know that it is a massive field but I hope one day I can one day get involved with it as well.
