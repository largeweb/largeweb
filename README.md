Hello! My name is Matthew Gordon. I am completing my Computer Science BS Degree with a Neuroscience minor at UNC Chapel Hill. I will finish this degree in Fall 2022. I will be looking for a Full Time position in January!

I would love to work on anything development/engineering related, and especially with new and exciting technologies! I am a very thoughtful and methodical programmer, and experienced with all kinds of frameworks and technologies. Some of my projects are available to view on this GitHub, and anything visible here is something that I have worked on to a relatively great extent (of course boilerplate in frameworks and a couple collaborative activities I can't take credit for) but I pride myself on being able to complete a proof-of-concept application from start to finish all on my own! I also enjoy working with others and communicate effectively in teams. I am most skilled working on web apps and low level system programming, and have done a lot in between. I believe I can provide immense value for companies who are working with new technologies and facing unique challenges, while also having an eye for opportunities to automate and innovate where it could work. I do lots of research in my spare time, involving Blockchain, Linux, AR/VR, Cloud Computing, and various development frameworks. I am very passionate about exploring all kinds of technologies and developing my skills. And I am capable of diving right into a comprehensive codebase to fix it up and build it out!

I am happy to call anytime on any day and discuss project ideas or job openings.
